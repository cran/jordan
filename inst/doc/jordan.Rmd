# Jordan algebras

To cite the `jordan` package in publications please use
[@hankin2023_jordan].  A _Jordan algebra_ is a non-associative algebra
over the reals with a bilinear multiplication that satisfies the
following identities:

$$xy=yx$$

$$(xy)(xx)=x(y(xx))$$

(the second identity is known as the Jordan identity).  In literature,
multiplication is usually indicated by juxtaposition but one sometimes
sees $x\circ y$.  Package idiom is to use an asterisk, as in `x*y`.
Following @mccrimmon1978, there are five types of Jordan algebras:

* *type 1*: Real symmetric matrices, class `real_symmetric_matrix`,
    abbreviated in the package to `rsm`
* *type 2*: Complex Hermitian matrices, class `complex_herm_matrix`,
    abbreviated to `chm`
* *type 3*: Quaternionic Hermitian matrices, class
    `quaternion_herm_matrix`, abbreviated to `qhm`
* *type 4*: Albert algebras, the space of $3\times 3$
    Hermitian octonionic matrices, class `albert`
* *type 5*: Spin factors, class `spin`

(of course, the first two are special cases of the next).  The
`jordan` package provides functionality to manipulate jordan objects
using natural R idiom.  Objects of all these classes are stored in
matrix form with columns being elements of the jordan algebra.  The
first four classes are matrix-based in the sense that the algebraic
objects are symmetric or Hermitian matrices (the S4 class is
`jordan_matrix`).  The fifth class, spin factors, is not matrix based.

# Matrix-based Jordan algebras, types 1,2,3

The four matrix-based Jordan algebras have elements which are square
matrices.  The first three classes are real (symmetric) matrices,
complex (Hermitian) matrices, and quaternionic (Hermitian); type 4 is
considered separately at the end.  Types 1,2, and 3 all behave in the
same way from a package idiom perspective.  Consider:

```{r}
x <- rrsm()  # "Random Real Symmetric Matrix"
y <- rrsm()  
z <- rrsm()  
x
```

Object `x` is a three-element vector, with each element being a
column.  Each element corresponds to a $5\times 5$ symmetric matrix
(because `rrsm()` has `d=5` by default, specifying the size of the
matrix).  Thus each element has $5*(5+1)/2=15$ degrees of freedom, as
indicated by the row labelling.  Addition and multiplication of a
Jordan object with a scalar are defined:

```{r}
x*100
x + y*3
x + 100
```

(the last line is motivated by analogy with `M + x`, for `M` a matrix
and `x` a scalar). Jordan objects may be multiplied using the rule
$x\circ y=(xy+yx)/2$:

```{r}
x*y
```

We may verify that the distributive law is obeyed:

```{r}
x*(y+z) - (x*y + x*z)
```

(that is, zero to numerical precision).  Further, we may observe that
the resulting algebra is not associative:

```{r}
LHS <- x*(y*z)
RHS <- (x*y)*z
LHS-RHS
```

showing numerically that $x(yz)\neq(xy)z$.  However, the Jordan
identity $(xy)(xx) = x(y(xx))$ is satisfied:

```{r}
LHS <- (x*y)*(x*x)
RHS <- x*(y*(x*x))
LHS-RHS
```

(the entries are zero to numerical precision).  If we wish to work
with the matrix itself, a single element may be coerced with
`as.1matrix()`:

```{r}
M1 <- as.1matrix(x[1])
(M2 <- as.1matrix(x[2]))
```

(in the above, observe how the matrix is indeed symmetric).  We may
verify that the multiplication rule is indeed being correctly
applied:

```{r}
(M1 %*% M2 + M2 %*% M1)/2 - as.1matrix(x[1]*x[2])
```

It is also possible to verify that symmetry is closed under the Jordan
operation:

```{r}
jj <- as.1matrix(x[1]*x[2])
jj-t(jj)
```

The other matrix-based Jordan algebras are similar but
differ in the details of the coercion.  Taking quaternionic matrices:

```{r}
as.1matrix(rqhm(n=1,d=2))
```

above we see the matrix functionality of the `onion` package being
used.  See how the matrix is Hermitian (elements `[1,2]` and `[2,1]`
are conjugate; elements `[1,1]` and `[2,2]` are pure real).  Verifying
the Jordan identity would be almost the same as above:

```{r}
x <- rqhm()
y <- rqhm()
(x*y)*(x*x) - x*(y*(x*x))
```

Above, we see that the difference is very small.

# Spin factors, type 5

The first four types of Jordan algebras are all matrix-based with
either real, complex, quaternionic, or octonionic entries.

The fifth type, spin factors, are slightly different from a package
idiom perspective.  Mathematically, elements are of the form
$\mathbb{R}\oplus\mathbb{R}^n$, with addition and multiplication
defined by

$$\alpha(a,\mathbf{a}) = (\alpha a,\alpha\mathbf{a})$$

$$(a,\mathbf{a}) + (b,\mathbf{b}) = (a+b,\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b})$$

$$(a,\mathbf{a}) \times (b,\mathbf{b}) =
(ab+\left\langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right\rangle,a\mathbf{b} +
b\mathbf{a})$$

where $a,b,\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$, and
$\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\in\mathbb{R}^n$.  Here
$\left\langle\cdot,\cdot\right\rangle$ is an inner product defined on
$\mathbb{R}^n$ (by default we have $\left\langle(x_1,\ldots,
x_n),(y_1,\ldots, y_n)\right\rangle=\sum x_iy_i$ but this is
configurable in the package).

So if we have $\mathcal{I},\mathcal{J},\mathcal{K}$ spin factor
elements it is clear that
$\mathcal{I}\mathcal{J}=\mathcal{J}\mathcal{I}$ and
$\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{J}+\mathcal{K}) = \mathcal{I}\mathcal{J} +
\mathcal{I}\mathcal{K}$.  The Jordan identity is not as easy to see
but we may verify all the identities numerically:


```{r}
I <- rspin()
J <- rspin()
K <- rspin()
I
I*J - J*I   # commutative:
I*(J+K) - (I*J + I*K)  # distributive:
I*(J*K) - (I*J)*K  # not associative:
(I*J)*(I*I) - I*(J*(I*I))  # Obeys the Jordan identity
```

# Albert algebras, type 4

Type 4 Jordan algebra corresponds to $3\times 3$ Hermitian matrices
with octonions for entries.  This is class `albert` in the package.
Note that octonionic Hermitian matrices of order 4 or above do not
satisfy the Jordan identity and are therefore not Jordan algebras:
there is a numerical illustration of this fact in the `onion` package
vignette.  We may verify the Jordan identity for $3\times 3$
octonionic Hermitian matrices using package class `albert`:

```{r}
x <- ralbert()
y <- ralbert()
x
(x*y)*(x*x)-x*(y*(x*x)) # Jordan identity:
```

# Special identities

In 1963, C. M. Glennie discovered a pair of identities satisfied by
special Jordan algebras but not the Albert algebra.  Defining

\[
U_x(y) = 2x(xy)-(xx)y
\]

\[
\left\lbrace x,y,z\right\rbrace=
2(x(yz)+(xy)z - (xz)y)
\]
 
(it can be shown that Jacobson's identity $U_{U_x(y)}=U_xU_yU_x$
holds), Glennie's identities are

\[
H_8(x,y,z)=H_8(y,x,z)\qquad H_9(x,y,z)=H_9(y,x,z)
\]

(see McCrimmon 2004 for details), where

\[
H_8(x,y,z)= \left\lbrace U_x U_y(z),z, xy\right\rbrace-U_xU_yU_z(xy)
\]

and
\[
H_9(x,y,z)= 2U_x(z) U_{y,x}U_z(yy)-U_x U_z U_{x,y} U_y(z)
\]

## Numerical verification of Jacobson

We may verify Jacobson's identity:

```{r,label=define_U_and_diff}
U <- function(x){function(y){2*x*(x*y)-(x*x)*y}}
diff <- function(x,y,z){
     LHS <- U(x)(U(y)(U(x)(z)))
     RHS <- U(U(x)(y))(z)
     return(LHS-RHS)  # zero if Jacobson holds
}
```

Then we may numerically verify Jacobson for type 3-5 Jordan algebras:

```{r,label=jacobsonverification,cache=TRUE}
diff(ralbert(),ralbert(),ralbert())  # Albert algebra obeys Jacobson:
diff(rqhm(),rqhm(),rqhm()) # Quaternion Jordan algebra obeys Jacobson:
diff(rspin(),rspin(),rspin()) # spin factors obey Jacobson:
```

showing agreement to numerical accuracy (the output is close to zero).
We can now verify Glennie's $G_8$ and $G_9$ identities.

## Numerical verification of $G_8$

```{r,label=defBH8G8}
B <- function(x,y,z){2*(x*(y*z) + (x*y)*z - (x*z)*y)}  # bracket function
H8 <- function(x,y,z){B(U(x)(U(y)(z)),z,x*y) - U(x)(U(y)(U(z)(x*y)))}
G8 <- function(x,y,z){H8(x,y,z)-H8(y,x,z)}
```

and so we verify for type 3 and type 5 Jordans:

```{r,label=verifyG8special,cache=TRUE}
G8(rqhm(1),rqhm(1),rqhm(1))   # Quaternion Jordan algebra obeys G8:
G8(rspin(1),rspin(1),rspin(1)) # Spin factors obey G8:
```

again showing acceptable accuracy.  The identity is *not* true for
Albert algebras:

```{r,cache=TRUE}
G8(ralbert(1),ralbert(1),ralbert(1)) # Albert algebra does not obey G8:
```

## Numerical verification of $G_9$

```{r,label=defineH9G9}
L <- function(x){function(y){x*y}}
U <- function(x){function(y){2*x*(x*y)-(x*x)*y}}
U2 <- function(x,y){function(z){L(x)(L(y)(z)) + L(y)(L(x)(z)) - L(x*y)(z)}}
H9 <- function(x,y,z){2*U(x)(z)*U2(y,x)(U(z)(y*y)) - U(x)(U(z)(U2(x,y)(U(y)(z))))}
G9 <- function(x,y,z){H9(x,y,z)-H9(y,x,z)}
```

Then we may verify the `G9()` identity for type 3 Jordans:

```{r,verifyG9identity,cache=TRUE}
G9(rqhm(1),rqhm(1),rqhm(1))  # Quaternion Jordan algebra obeys G9:
```

However, the Albert algebra does not satisfy the identity:

```{r,albertH9G9,cache=TRUE}
G9(ralbert(1),ralbert(1),ralbert(1)) # Albert algebra does not obey G9:
```
