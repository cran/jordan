# Jordan algebras

A _Jordan algebra_ is a non-associative algebra over the reals with
a bilinear multiplication that satisfies the following identities:

$$xy=yx$$

$$(xy)(xx)=x(y(xx))$$

(the second identity is known as the Jordan identity).  In literature,
multiplication is usually indicated by juxtaposition but one sometimes
sees $x\circ y$.  Package idiom is to use an asterisk, as in `x*y`.
There are five types of Jordan algebras:

* Real symmetric matrices, class `real_symmetric_matrix`,
    abbreviated in the package to `rsm`
* Complex Hermitian matrices, class `complex_herm_matrix`,
    abbreviated to `chm`
* Quaternionic Hermitian matrices, class
    `quaternion_herm_matrix`, abbreviated to `qhm`
* Albert algebras, the space of $3\times 3$
    Hermitian octonionic matrices, class `albert`
* Spin factors, class `spin`

(of course, the first two are special cases of the next).  The
`jordan` package provides functionality to manipulate jordan objects
using natural R idiom.  Objects of all these classes are stored in
matrix form with columns being elements of the jordan algebra.  The
first four classes are matrix-based in the sense that the algebraic
objects are symmetric or Hermitian matrices (the S4 class is
`jordan_matrix`).  The fifth class, spin factors, is not matrix based.

## Matrix-based Jordan algebras

The four matrix-based Jordan algebras have elements which are square
matrices.  The first three classes are real (symmetric) matrices,
complex (Hermitian) matrices, and quaternionic (Hermitian) These all
behave in the same way from a package idiom perspective.  Consider:

```{r}
x <- rrsm()  # "Random Real Symmetric Matrix"
y <- rrsm()  
z <- rrsm()  
x
```

Object `x` is a three-element vector, with each element corresponding
to a $x\times 5$ symmetric matrix (because `rrsm()` has `d=5` by
default, specifying the size of the matrix).  Thus each element has
$5*(5+1)/2=15$ degrees of freedom, as indicated by the row labelling.
Addition and multiplication of a Jordan object with a scalar are
defined:

```{r}
x*100
x + y*3
x + 100
```

(the last line is motivated by analogy with `M + x`, for `M` a matrix
and `x` a scalar). Jordan objects may be multiplied using the rule
$x\circ y=(xy+yx)/2$:

```{r}
x*y
```

We may verify that the distributive law is obeyed:

```{r}
x*(y+z) - (x*y + x*z)
```

Further, we may observe that the resulting algebra is not associative:

```{r}
LHS <- x*(y*z)
RHS <- (x*y)*z
LHS-RHS
```

However, the Jordan identity $(xy)(xx) = x(y(xx))$ is satisfied:

```{r}
LHS <- (x*y)*(x*x)
RHS <- x*(y*(x*x))
LHS-RHS
```

(the entries are zero to numerical precision).  If we wish to work
with the matrix itself, a single element may be coerced with
`as.1matrix()`:

```{r}
M1 <- as.1matrix(x[1])
(M2 <- as.1matrix(x[2]))
```

(in the above, observe how the matrix is indeed symmetric).  We may
verify that the multiplication rule is indeed being correctly
applied:

```{r}
(M1 %*% M2 + M2 %*% M1)/2 - as.1matrix(x[1]*x[2])
```

It is also possible to verify that symmetry is closed under the Jordan
operation:

```{r}
jj <- as.1matrix(x[1]*x[2])
jj-t(jj)
```

The other matrix-based Jordan algebras are similar but
differ in the details of the coercion.  Taking quaternionic matrices:

```{r}
as.1matrix(rqhm(n=1,d=2))
```

above we see the matrix functionality of the `onion` package being
used.  See how the matrix is Hermitian (elements `[1,2]` and `[2,1]`
are conjugate; elements `[1,1]` and `[2,2]` are pure real).  Verifying
the Jordan identity would be almost the same as above:

```{r}
x <- rqhm()
y <- rqhm()
(x*y)*(x*x) - x*(y*(x*x))
```

## Spin factors

The fifth class is slightly different from a package idiom
perspective.  Mathematically, elements are of the form
$\mathbb{R}\oplus\mathbb{R}^n$, with addition and multiplication
defined by

$$\alpha(a,\mathbf{a}) = (\alpha a,\alpha\mathbf{a})$$

$$(a,\mathbf{a}) + (b,\mathbf{b}) = (a+b,\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b})$$

$$(a,\mathbf{a}) \times (b,\mathbf{b}) =
(ab+\left\langle\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right\rangle,a\mathbf{b} +
b\mathbf{a})$$

where $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$, and $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\in\mathbb{R}^n$.
Here $\left\langle\cdot,\cdot\right\rangle$ is an inner product
defined on $\mathbb{R}^n$ (by default we have
$\left\langle(x_1,\ldots, x_n),(y_1,\ldots, y_n)\right\rangle=\sum
x_iy_i$ but this is configurable in the package).

So if we have $\mathcal{I},\mathcal{J},\mathcal{K}$ spin factor
elements it is clear that
$\mathcal{I}\mathcal{J}=\mathcal{J}\mathcal{I}$ and
$\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{J}+\mathcal{K}) = \mathcal{I}\mathcal{J} +
\mathcal{I}\mathcal{K}$.  The Jordan identity is not as easy to see
but we may verify all the identities numerically:


```{r}
I <- rspin()
J <- rspin()
K <- rspin()
I
I*J - J*I   # commutative:
I*(J+K) - (I*J + I*K)  # distributive:
I*(J*K) - (I*J)*K  # not associative:
(I*J)*(I*I) - I*(J*(I*I))  # Obeys the Jordan identity
```

# Albert algebras

Class 4 corresponds to $3\times 3$ Hermitian matrices with octonions
for entries.  This is class `albert` in the package:

```{r}
x <- ralbert()
y <- ralbert()
x
(x*y)*(x*x)-x*(y*(x*x)) # Jordan identity:
```

# Special identities

In 1963, C. M. Glennie discovered a pair of identities satisfied by
special Jordan algebras but not the Albert algebra.  Defining

\[
U_x(y) = 2x(xy)-(xx)y
\]

\[
\left\lbrace x,y,z\right\rbrace=
2(x(yz)+(xy)z - (xz)y)
\]
 
(it can be shown that Jacobson's identity $U_{U_x(y)}=U_xU_yU_x$
holds), Glennie's identities are

\[
H_8(x,y,z)=H_8(y,x,z)\qquad H_9(x,y,z)=H_9(y,x,z)
\]

(see McCrimmon 2004 for details), where

\[
H_8(x,y,z)= \left\lbrace U_x U_y(z),z, xy\right\rbrace-U_xU_yU_z(xy)
\]

and
\[
H_9(x,y,z)= 2U_x(z) U_{y,x}U_z(yy)-U_x U_z U_{x,y} U_y(z)
\]

## Numerical verification of Jacobson

We may verify Jacobson's identity:

```{r,label=define_U_and_diff}
U <- function(x){function(y){2*x*(x*y)-(x*x)*y}}
diff <- function(x,y,z){
     LHS <- U(x)(U(y)(U(x)(z)))
     RHS <- U(U(x)(y))(z)
     return(LHS-RHS)  # zero if Jacobson holds
}
```

Then we may numerically verify Jacobson for type 3-5 Jordan algebras:

```{r,label=jacobsonverification,cache=TRUE}
diff(ralbert(),ralbert(),ralbert())  # Albert algebra obeys Jacobson:
diff(rqhm(),rqhm(),rqhm()) # Quaternion Jordan algebra obeys Jacobson:
diff(rspin(),rspin(),rspin()) # spin factors obey Jacobson:
```

showing agreement to numerical accuracy (the output is close to zero).
We can now verify Glennie's $G_8$ and $G_9$ identities.

## Numerical verification of $G_8$

```{r,label=defBH8G8}
B <- function(x,y,z){2*(x*(y*z) + (x*y)*z - (x*z)*y)}  # bracket function
H8 <- function(x,y,z){B(U(x)(U(y)(z)),z,x*y) - U(x)(U(y)(U(z)(x*y)))}
G8 <- function(x,y,z){H8(x,y,z)-H8(y,x,z)}
```

and so we verify for type 3 and type 5 Jordans:

```{r,label=verifyG8special,cache=TRUE}
G8(rqhm(1),rqhm(1),rqhm(1))   # Quaternion Jordan algebra obeys G8:
G8(rspin(1),rspin(1),rspin(1)) # Spin factors obey G8:
```

again showing acceptable accuracy.  The identity is *not* true for
Albert algebras:

```{r,cache=TRUE}
G8(ralbert(1),ralbert(1),ralbert(1)) # Albert algebra does not obey G8:
```

## Numerical verification of $G_9$

```{r,label=defineH9G9}
L <- function(x){function(y){x*y}}
U <- function(x){function(y){2*x*(x*y)-(x*x)*y}}
U2 <- function(x,y){function(z){L(x)(L(y)(z)) + L(y)(L(x)(z)) - L(x*y)(z)}}
H9 <- function(x,y,z){2*U(x)(z)*U2(y,x)(U(z)(y*y)) - U(x)(U(z)(U2(x,y)(U(y)(z))))}
G9 <- function(x,y,z){H9(x,y,z)-H9(y,x,z)}
```

Then we may verify the `G9()` identity for type 3 Jordans:

```{r,verifyG9identity,cache=TRUE}
G9(rqhm(1),rqhm(1),rqhm(1))  # Quaternion Jordan algebra obeys G9:
```

However, the Albert algebra does not satisfy the identity:

```{r,albertH9G9,cache=TRUE}
G9(ralbert(1),ralbert(1),ralbert(1)) # Albert algebra does not obey G9:
```
